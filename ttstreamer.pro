# Clang Code Model was a nuisance after Qt Creator 4.11.0 Qt 5.12.8
#Go into Help->About Plugins and uncheck the Clang code model plugin.
#You have to restart qt creator after that to make it take effect.
#I had the same problem when debugging a unit test. I was debugging code
#not in the project itself and it was dying repeatedly on me sending tons of kernel messages.
