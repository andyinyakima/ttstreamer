README Take off of tttuner for ttstreamer
WILL EDIT AS NECESSARY

This program is in beta stage. Started developing on Kernel v 2.6 am now using v 3.5.0

My approach is not to reinvent the wheel but enhance the use of the wheel.
Also the program was developed with a technicians point of view. Am always looking for
ways to improve monitoring tuner streams.
Portability also, I want this to work on a laptop, albeit a powerful laptop with USB 3.

Ok,

"ttstreamer" is basically a 4 tuner streamer just for ATSC,maybe later; a version for all types of digital tuners.

I develop using QtCreator on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04






After installing Qt "open project" by going to the folder where you placed
the files. 

	1)main.cpp
	2)ttstreamer.cpp
	3)ttstreamer.h
	4)ttstreamer.ui
	5)ttstreamer.pro	
	6)README (this file)

Open ttstreamer.pro; it contains the info that Qt needs.

You also need "scan" which can be installed using:

 	sudo apt-get install dvb-apps



One more item needed is VLC 3.0.0:

	Might not need this any more:
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:videolan/master-daily
	
	
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install vlc

After downloading vlc execute it and go into Tools/Preferences. Uncheck the box for single instance;
 you want multiple instances of vlc. 

 

Using mpv to show streams but in "ttviewer"

  	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/mpv-tests
  	sudo apt update && sudo apt install mpv

For qtcreator you need to install:

	sudo apt-get install qtmultimedia5-dev


After successfully compiling you should have a gui with 4 adapter groups 0-3,
each group will have a box that states type of tuner. ATSC adapters will
be enabled. Make sure the Service Scan button is checked, then press the "Tune"
button. w_scan (scan) should take over and scan, which you can observe in the left browser.
After successful scan it will produce a Channel list in the right browser; the
channel numbers can be placed in the enabled boxes and if they a legitimate channels will
turn red. Tuner functions are Create Streams, Show Videos and TuneTo; select one of these
and press "Tune". 

added 11 Jan 2022 for Hauppauge tuners-----------------
First, determine the version of Ubuntu you are running
To do this, run this command:

dpkg -l | grep linux-image-generic-hwe

If a line is displayed beginning with "ii", then you are running the HWE version of Ubuntu. You will need to know if you are running HWE this in a moment when you install the mediatree.

Download the PPA

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:b-rad/kernel+mediatree+hauppauge

After this first line, click enter when prompted to add this PPA.

sudo apt-get update

Install the media tree

If you are running an HWE version of Ubuntu, use this command:

sudo apt-get install linux-hwe-mediatree

If you are NOT running HWE, use this command:

sudo apt-get install linux-mediatree
Firmware Install

At this point, you also need to install TV firmware if you are using one of the following TV tuners (most North American TV tuners do NOT need firmware to be loaded, so this mainly applies to European/ANZ tuners):

    a Hauppauge DVB TV tuner in Europe, Australia or New Zealand (example: WinTV-soloHD, WinTV-dualHD, WinTV-quadHD, WinTV-HVR-5525, Starburst 2, etc.)
    461e or WinTV-NOVA-S2
    WinTV-quadHD USB for North America

To download and install Hauppauge TV tuner firmware, run this command:

sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-hauppauge

Close Terminal and restart your computer.

You can now connect your Hauppauge WinTV TV tuner to your computer and it should be available for use by your Linux TV watching application. 

end of Happauge addition---------------------------


That's it for now,

Addendum: 2July2016

Made some modifications- removed w_scan because it wouldn't create the correct zap files.
Installed "scan" in its place. VLC has been replaced with mpv it is much more manageable.
Am using UDP instead of RTP to for the communication protocol. 

This will be added to bitbucket using git instead of mercurial.

07 March 2019 

Added multicast addressing .i.e address box defaults to 127.0.0.1 but can be edited to 239.1.1.234 or 
similar multicast address 

Added two "scan" files, yakima_ATSC.txt has the frequencies for Yakima un-commented so that
they will be picked up during a scan. USA_ATSC.txt is fully commented, just un-comment the
# marks for your area frequencies and those stations will be scanned in.



sudo apt install qtcreator
sudo apt install qt5-default

# Clang Code Model was a nuisance after Qt Creator 4.11.0 Qt 5.12.8
#Go into Help->About Plugins and uncheck the Clang code model plugin.
#You have to restart qt creator after that to make it take effect.
#I had the same problem when debugging a unit test. I was debugging code
#not in the project itself and it was dying repeatedly on me sending tons of kernel messages.

// Oct 18 2022 
 // had a site where ch 8 had a port number of 801 and the "ttviewer" would not play
 // I then decided to make a single digit channel number have a 4 prepended to their port number
 // had to go with 4 as 1-3 were allocated to 10-36
 // so that hopefully it will play on ttviewer
 // tested it on ch 8 and it worked !!


// also added: QMAKE_LFLAGS += -no-pie # this allows me to make a desktop Icon that runs when pressed
// to 'ttsreamer.pro'
// this allows me to copy an icon for ttstreamer from the build directory onto my Desktop this icon will run ttstreamer
